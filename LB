# Load Balancing 

Load balancing read operations in a StatefulSet with MySQL databases can be achieved by implementing several strategies. Here are some common approaches:

ProxySQL or HAProxy:

Use a dedicated database proxy such as ProxySQL or HAProxy in front of the MySQL StatefulSet.
These proxies can distribute read queries to different database replicas based on load balancing algorithms.
They often support features like connection pooling and read-write splitting.
MySQL Router:

MySQL Router is a lightweight middleware that can handle load balancing for MySQL.
It can be deployed as a separate service or as a sidecar alongside your MySQL StatefulSet Pods.
MySQL Router uses various algorithms for load balancing and can distribute read queries across multiple database replicas.
Custom Application Logic:

Implement custom logic in your application to distribute read queries among different database replicas.
The application can maintain a list of available replicas and route read queries based on a load balancing strategy.
MySQL Read-Only Replicas:

Configure MySQL replicas as read-only replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database.
Clients can connect to read-only replicas for read operations, while write operations are directed to the primary replica.
MySQL driver configurations may be needed to specify which operations can be executed on read-only replicas.
